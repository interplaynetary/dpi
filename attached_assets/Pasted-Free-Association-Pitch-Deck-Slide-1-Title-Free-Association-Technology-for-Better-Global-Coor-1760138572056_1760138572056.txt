Free-Association: Pitch Deck 
Slide 1: Title 
Free-Association 
Technology for Better Global Coordination 
Ready for COP30 | $200K Investment 
Slide 2: The Problem 
$188M lost annually due to coordination failures 
Resources flow to wrong places at wrong times 
No real-time visibility into who's doing what, where 
Values and priorities disconnected from actual resource allocation 
We need Digital Public Infrastructure for global coordination 
Slide 3: The Solution 
Free-Association: Values-driven resource coordination platform 
Real-time coordination that works offline 
Peer-to-peer architecture scaling to billions 
Values-aligned resource distribution 
Interoperable with existing systems 
Slide 4: How It Works 
Simple 3-Step Process: 
1. Express Values: What matters to you right now? 
2. Recognize Contributors: Who helps achieve your priorities? (100% total recognition) 3. Share Resources: Your capacity flows to mutual recognition partnersResult: Resources automatically flow where they create the most mutual value 
Slide 5: Real-World Example 
Country-to-Country Coordination 
Tanzania recognizes Brazil's agricultural contributions → Brazil recognizes Tanzania's environmental work → Mutual Recognition formed → Tanzania needs agricultural expertise → Brazil has 5,000 hours available → Automatic priority allocation based on mutual recognition strength 
Slide 6: Market Opportunity 
$73M funding pipeline across 4 sectors: 
Philanthropic Foundations: $25M (Gates, MacArthur, Omidyar) 
Government Agencies: $21M (USAID, DFID, GIZ) 
Multilateral Orgs: $22M (World Bank, UNDP) 
Corporate Philanthropy: $5M (Microsoft, Google.org) 
Slide 7: Proven Traction 
200+ active contributors including: 
Rüzgar Imski (Playnet Founder, Core Algorithm Developer) 
Lubna Dajani (Catalyst Now USA, Allternet Founder) 
Technical team with P2P and security expertise 
Current Interest: Family offices, banks, schools, impact funders 
Slide 8: Technical Advantage 
83% cost reduction vs traditional platforms 
Operating Costs: 
100K users: $119-358/month 
3M users: $3,570-10,710/month 
8B users: $9.5M-28.5M/month 
Peer-to-peer architecture eliminates centralized server costs 
Slide 9: Implementation Status
COP30 Ready with $200K investment 
✅ Complete: P2P functionality, capacity mapping, priority distribution ⌛ In Progress: Security hardening, AI integration, custom interfaces 
Timeline: Fully operational for COP30 (6 months) 
Slide 10: The Vision 
A Full Stack Commons for Human Coordination 
Transform how humanity coordinates resources - from local communities to global institutions - by aligning resource flows with collective values and mutual contribution. 
Impact: Enable effective coordination on climate, health, education, and social challenges at unprecedented scale. 
Slide 11: Investment Ask 
$200K for COP30 deployment 
$1M for global scale (saves $188M annually) 
Use of Funds: 
Security infrastructure (40%) 
AI integration (30%) 
Custom interfaces (20%) 
Operations (10%) 
ROI: 188x cost savings through coordination efficiency 
Slide 12: Next Steps 
Ready to deploy at COP30 
Contact: 
Funding via Playnet Open Collective (tax-deductible) 
Technical partnerships available 
Pilot programs with early adopters
The infrastructure humanity needs to coordinate effectively already exists. We just need to build it.

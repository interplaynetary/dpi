# Free Association Site Governance

**Status:** Initial framework (evolving with community input)

## Principles

1. **Technical Authority:** Protocol decisions based on mathematical correctness 
   and empirical testing
2. **Community Input:** All stakeholders can propose changes through RFC process
3. **Transparent Process:** Decisions documented publicly
4. **Consensus-Seeking:** Prefer broad agreement over quick decisions

## Protocol Changes

### RFC Process
1. Submit proposal as GitHub issue with `protocol-rfc` tag
2. Community discussion (minimum 2 weeks)
3. Reference implementation team assesses technical merit
4. Decision documented and announced

### Types of Changes
- **Editorial:** Clarifications to documentation (approved by maintainers)
- **Minor:** Backwards-compatible additions (RFC process, 2-week discussion)
- **Major:** Breaking changes to protocol (RFC process, 4-week discussion, requires strong justification)

## Maintainers

Current core mantainer: Tom Guimberteau

Maintainer responsibilities:
- Review contributions
- Facilitate RFC discussions
- Ensure test suite coverage
- Maintain reference implementation

## Community Participation

Everyone is welcome to:
- Submit issues and RFCs
- Participate in discussions
- Contribute code improvements
- Share implementation experiences

## Decision Authority

For protocol changes:
- Community feedback is sought and valued
- Technical correctness is verified through proofs/tests
- Core mantainer makes final decision with documented rationale
- Controversial decisions may be escalated to broader stakeholder vote

## Trademark Policy

*(Coming soon - trademark application in process)*

For now: "Free Association" name should be used accurately. Modified or 
derivative versions should be clearly marked as such.
